    /*  conditional<typename ToF_Type, typename T, typename F>,
        like its standard counterpart, provides either type T
        or F depending on ToF_Type.

        Template Parameters:
            * ToF_Type - either std::true_type or std::false_type
            * T - member type if ToF_Type is std::true_type
            * F - member type if ToF_Type is std::false_type
        Members:
            * type - Either T or F depending on ToF_Type being
                std::true_type or std::false_type, respectively.

        Example use:
                //Creates an int type variable
            Type_Trait::conditional<
                std::is_same<int, int>::type,   //Condition

    /*  any_true<T1, Tn...> takes a list of std::integral_constant
        instantiations and determines if any of them is std::true_type.
        At least one parameter must be provided.

        Template Parameters:
            * T1 - a std::integral_constant instantiation
            * Tn... - additional instantiations
        Members:
            * type - equivalent to std::true_type if at least one of the
                parameters is std::true_type. std::false_type otherwise.

        Example use:
            typedef std::true_type tt;
            typedef std::false_type ft;
                //Creates a char type variable
            Type_Trait::conditional<
                Type_Trait::any_true<ft, ft, ft, ft, ft, ft, ft, tt>::type,

    /*  count_matches<T1, T2, Tn...> takes type T1 and compares it to
        the rest of the parameter list, counting the total number of
        types that match it. At least two parameters must be provided.

        Template Parameters:
            * T1 - the type to check for
            * T2 - the first type to check against
            * Tn... - additional types to check against
        Members:
            * type - equivalent to std::true_type if at least one match
                is found. std::false_type otherwise.
            * match - a std::size_t variable that stores the number of
                matches found.

        Example use:
            assert(Type_Trait::count_matches<int, int, char, int>::match == 2);

    /*  find_base<Derived, BaseN...> looks for the first type in the BaseN
        parameter pack that is a base type of Derived. Note that only the
        first result is found and retrievable. If none of the types is a
        base type of Derived or there is no BaseN list provided, the member
        type will be equivalent to Derived.

        Template Parameters:
            * Derived - the type whose base is looked for
            * BaseN... - the list of types to check
        Members:
            * type - equivalent to std::true_type if a base type was found.
                std::false_type otherwise.
            * base - the type of the first result that is a base type of
                Derived. If no match was found or no list was provided,
                this type is equivalent to Derived.

        Example use:
            assert(Type_Trait::count_matches<int, int, char, int>::match == 2);

    /*  switch_case<N, T, Tn...> is like the switch-case expression except
        this is for selecting types given an index number. This also means
        this class is similar to std::tuple and std::get. This class is
        to std::conditional as the switch-case expression is to the
        if-else expression.

        Template Parameters:
            * N - a std::size_t object. This is the compile-time index that
                chooses a type out of the list.
            * T - the first type/case
            * Tn... - additional cases
        Members:
            * type - the resultant type from choosing the (N+1)th type from
                the type list. For example, if N == 0, type would be
                equivalent to T.

        Example use:
            constexpr std::size_t get_half(std::size_t n)
                {return n >> 1;}

                //Creates a char type variable
            Type_Trait::switch_case<
                get_half(6),                //The condition / index
                int,                        //Case 0
                float,                      //Case 1
                std::size_t,                //Case 2
                char,                       //Case 3
                double                      //Case 4
